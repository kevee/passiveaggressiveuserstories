The corpus is small, do a pull request to make it happy! Note that in perhaps an abuse of build tools for such a silly site, we us [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to package javascripts. Are you not happy with pull requests? File an issue, we'd love to add your real-world examples of user stories to the compendium!
